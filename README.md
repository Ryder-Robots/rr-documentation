## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based drone system that utilizes Deep Neural 
Networks (DNN) for object avoidance and  navigation. The project aims to create autonomous drones 
capable of navigating complex environments while avoiding obstacles.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To develop an efficient and reliable obstacle avoidance system for drones using DNN.
2. To implement an adaptive navigation system using RL that can operate in various environments.
3. To create a framework that can be easily adapted for different types of drones and missions.

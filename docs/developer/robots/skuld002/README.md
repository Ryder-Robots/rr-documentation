# Circuit Board Notes

For current calculation, the formula is $R = \frac{V}{I_m}$

where:
- R = resistance measured in Ohms
- V = voltage measured in volts
- I = current measured in Amps

For ultra-sonics the calculation becomes:

$R = \frac{V}{3I_m}$

the coefficients being the 3 SEN0304.

$R = \frac{3.3}{3(20 \times 0.001)} = \frac{3.3}{3(20 \times 0.001)} = \frac{3.3}{0.06} = 55\Omega$ 

therefore the capacitor required is:

$V(t) = V_0.e^-\frac{t}{RC}$

Where:
- V(t) = Voltage at time  3.3v
- Vâ‚€ = Initial voltage 3.3v
- R = Resistance (55$\Omega$)
- C = Capacitance
- t = Time (10ms = 0.01s)

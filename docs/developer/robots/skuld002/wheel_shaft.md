# Wheel Shaft

Creates a shaft to connect Mecanum Wheel to TT Engine.

$I = \frac{(n - 2) \times 180^\circ}{n} = 120$

where: I = interior angle, and n is number of sides, and there are six sides.

According to DF Robot datasheet, hub size is 7.62mm, therefore each size needs to be 
$\frac{7.62}{\frac{6}{2}} = 2.54$ Shaft size of the hub is given as 16.7mm, so adding 1.5mm onto this.

$l = 16.7 + 1.5 = 18.2$

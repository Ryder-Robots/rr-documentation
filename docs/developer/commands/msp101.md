DNN to make navigation decisions.

## cycletime

Frequency of consecutive executions of microprocessor/flight controller PID algorithm.

For example if queues.thread_wait_time is set to 500,  and cycletime returns as 10, it indicates
that there has been 10 executions of the PID algorithm in the last execution.

## i2c_errors_count

For PID algorithm that can be represented as:

$\large{ u(t)=K_pe(t)+K_i \int_0^t e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt},}$

i2c_error_count represents the integral portion of the equation. Or the summation of:

$\large{\int_0^t e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt},}$

or the "I" proportion of the equation. As this equation is executed "cycletime"s for each given
[MSP104](msp101.md) or for each waypoint specified within [MSP8](msp8.md) command, the instantaneous
error.

## sensor

Displays which sensors are available to the drone represented as a bit-mask. Sensors are as follows

| Sensor   | bitmask value     | description   |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| BARO     | 0b000000000000001 | Barometer     |
| MAG      | 0b000000000000010 | magnetometer  |
| GPS      | 0b000000000000100 | GPS           |
| SONAR    | 0b000000000001000 | ultra sonic   |
| CAMERA   | 0b000000000010000 | camera        |
| GRYO     | 0b000000000100000 | Gyroscope     |

Sensor flags are Or'd together for instance:

0b000000000100100 represents that Gyroscope and GPS is available.

## flag 

Indicates current mode and status of the drone. This is done by Or'ing RRP_STATUS and CMODE.

### RRP_STATUS

| RRP_STATUS    | Bitmap     | Description                                                 |
|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| INITILIZING   | 0b0000001  | At least one handler is initializing                        |
| ACTIVE        | 0b0000010  | All handlers have initialized without error, drone is armed |
| ERROR         | 0b0000100  | At least one handler is experienced an error                |
| RELOADING     | 0b0001000  | Handler that has experienced error is reloading.            |
| SHUTTING_DOWN | 0b0010000  | Drone is powering down                                      |
| TERMINATED    | 0b0100000  | Handler has been terminated                                 |

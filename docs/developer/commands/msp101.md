## cycletime

Frequency of consecutive executions of microprocessor/flight controller PID algorithm.

For example if queues.thread_wait_time is set to 500,  and cycletime returns as 10, it indicates
that there has been 10 executions of the PID algorithm in the last execution.

## i2c_errors_count

$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
